This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This can happen if the cleanup function attempts to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error might not be immediately obvious, as it often only manifests when navigating away from the screen quickly or repeatedly.  The error message itself might be cryptic, offering little clue about the unmount-related timing issue.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('some-api-endpoint');
        const json = await response.json();
        setData(json);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    return () => {
      // This cleanup function might throw an error if the component
      // is unmounted before this function completes.
      console.log('Cleaning up...');  //This line might cause the error
      // someOtherFunctionThatMightThrowError()
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... JSX ... */}
    </View>
  );
};

```
